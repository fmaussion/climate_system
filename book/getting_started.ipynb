    "Jupyter Notebooks are a relatively recent addition to the scientific python ecosystem. They were previously called \"ipython notebooks\" (you might find them under this name in old forums or websites sometimes). The advantage of jupyter notebooks over traditional code scripts in text files is that they can include text, code, and plots in the same document. Notebooks are a fantastic tool to explore data or models and to communicate about science. \n",
