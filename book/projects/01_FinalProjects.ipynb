    "You will write a short report in the form of a Jupyter Notebook: containing all analyses, plots, as well as interpretations. You will structure your report around the stated research question with (1) a short introduction and statement of the research question, (2) development and analyses, and (3) conclusions. The research questions can be formulated in one to three sentences and can be descriptive or quantitative  (e.g. _\"What are the main features of the precipitation climate of South America?\"_,  _\"What are the main differences between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles?\"_, _\"What is the effect of the NAO on the North European climate?\"_, etc.). \n",

    "The analyses can (and should) be driven by the scientific literature, i.e. you are encouraged to find scientific papers from which you can reproduce the analyses with your own data. \n",

    "- independent formulation of a simple research question related to the lecture \n",
    "- application of the tools discovered in the lecture (Notebooks, xarray) to a real-world research question\n",
    "- group work and discussion: you will have to decide on responsibilities (who downloads the data, searches literature, writes, etc.)"
